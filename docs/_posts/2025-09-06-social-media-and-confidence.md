title: Social Media and Confidence
---

I've noticed that the more time I spend on social media, the less confident I feel. Here's why I think that is:

There are two personality traits that contribute to it: my avoidant nature and lack of solid ideals: I am unable to hold my beliefs for a long time, reality often points out contradictions in my beliefs.

This, combined with the phrase 'you are always wrong on the internet', makes me feel my opinions are invalid or with technical fault. It drains confidence. It makes you second guess everything.

### Pros

- Since I second guess everything, the likelihood of me failing when trying something new is lower.

---

### Cons

- Sadly, I am less likely to try something new, as I will not have confidence to start it.

- I have a hard time conveying my ideas, even within personal social circles.

- I often say something, and right after, follow with a counter argument to my own statement. This makes it harder for others to continue a conversation with me.

The ability to believe something is a blessing, even if it is ignorant. It helps you make friends with people who believe the same. It builds your confidence and your social circle. The only caveat is, if your beliefs don't benefit you, you will be left behind.

Recognising this is a step in building my confidence, social circle and shaping how I engage with social media.
